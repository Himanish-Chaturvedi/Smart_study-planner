Smart Study Planner: A fully interactive, client-side application for task management featuring Local Storage persistence, Web Notification Reminders, and visual progress tracking (Progress Gauges).

This project is a highly interactive Single-Page Application (SPA) designed to boost student productivity by replacing static to-do lists with an intelligent, data-driven planning system. It fully integrates core web technologies to deliver a sophisticated user experience.

Key Features & Technical Highlights:
Proactive Reminder System: Integrates the Web Notification API to deliver native desktop reminders for time-sensitive tasks, fulfilling a core project requirement.

Intelligent Status Tracking: Tasks are sorted by urgency (Overdue > Pending > Completed). Overdue tasks are visually flagged with a pulsing CSS animation.

Visual Timeline (Progress Gauges): Dynamically calculates and displays study progress per category using CSS conic-gradient rings, providing crucial visual feedback.

Data Persistence: Implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with all data securely stored on the client side using the Local Storage API.

Interactive Design: Features an attractive, modern layout with 3D-like hover effects achieved through CSS Transforms and Transitions.

Technology Stack: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
